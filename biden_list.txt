Every Sunday during the Biden Administration, I hope to make a bullet-point post about a collection of remaining problems not only from the Trump administration, but also other past administrations (Obama, Bush, Clinton, etc.), and what's being done about them as far as I can scour on the web. If the 2020 elections made anything clear with record turnout, there are some deep fissures that we need to be conscious of, and do what we can collectively to at least mitigate if not resolve. ***Contact your representative in the US House and your Senators to voice your thoughts on these and other issues, and just do what you can.***

- Pandemic economic stimulus: Harris got the 'blueprint' for it through. Otherwise, disappointingly stalled

- This Twitter account is useful -> https://twitter.com/WaitingOnBiden so a handful of what follows could come from that 

- Tangential to economic stimulus is the cancelling of student debt -> Rumblings still... Chuck Shumer hashtagged support this week, along with Elizabeth Warren, amongst others. Executive action is on the table

- Family separations at the US-Mexico border, and the related detention/concentration camps (overview -> https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a27813648/concentration-camps-southern-border-migrant-detention-facilities-trump/):
-- Discussion on The Hill -> https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/537629-biden-immigration-policy-looks-beyond-reversing-trump
-- More executive orders this week:

- Citizenship for undocumented immigrants: in progress, looks like mostly localized stuff happened this past week, nothing on the national level

- Healthcare: nada this week. Vaccinations continue, albeit at a slower pace than needed. Some of last week's actions probably need to settle in to take effect.

- Marijuana legalization: State-level legalization efforts of many varieties in full steam... google'm

- Systemic racism: discussion pieces mainly from my POV

- Gun reform -> usual reaction to this. Google "Gun Reform Biden"

- Climate, last, not at all least: seems like opine pieces and just on-the-ground reports across the board

I've saved this list so I can add on, take out as needed. Heck, it may be useful to make a GitHub of it, and I did -> https://github.com/JoesephPaulSmith/BidenAdminMon . Anywho, again, we need to do what we can, and not lose sight of what's possible with the new arrangement in the national government. 

Good luck everyone, and have a good week
