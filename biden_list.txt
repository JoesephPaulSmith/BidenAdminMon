Trump's first was on January 29, 2017 - Yemen raid on Al Qaeda - so about month earlier in his presidency (https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-raid-kills-qaeda-linked-yemen-tribe-chiefs-073853092.html). Regardless, not a good look at all, given a pandemic. Other Dems in the party, given the party is basically the US Political equivalent of Academia (happy to critique professionally), had some pretty clear criticisms:

- Let's keep the pressure on Trump, ensuring he can never take office again. 
-- March 4 is this coming week, which is high-time for spun-up conspiracy people to see that Trump is inaugurated as the "19th President" of the United States.

--- Trump spoke... originally meant for 3:40p EST, and then rescheduled for 4:55p EST. Apparently he came out shortly before that though.

- This Twitter account is useful -> https://twitter.com/WaitingOnBiden so a handful of what follows could come from that 

- Tangential to economic stimulus is the cancelling of student debt: it wasn't part of the stimulus bill...

- Family separations at the US-Mexico border, and the related detention/concentration camps (overview -> https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a27813648/concentration-camps-southern-border-migrant-detention-facilities-trump/): looks like just chatter this week

- Healthcare: The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, delivered to "Janssen Biotech Inc., a Janssen Pharmaceutical Company of Johnson & Johnson" -> https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-issues-emergency-use-authorization-third-covid-19-vaccine

- Systemic racism: Independent UN human rights experts chimed in with their thoughts for the new administration -> https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/02/1085872

- Gun reform: nothing new... 

- Climate, last, not at all least: nothing new...

I've saved this list so I can add on, take out as needed. Heck, it may be useful to make a GitHub of it, and I did -> https://github.com/JoesephPaulSmith/BidenAdminMon . Anywho, again, we need to do what we can, and not lose sight of what's possible with the new arrangement in the national government. 

Lastly, contact your representative in the US House and your Senators to voice your thoughts on these and other issues.

Good luck everyone, and have a good week
