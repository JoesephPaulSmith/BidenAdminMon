Every Sunday during the Biden Administration, I hope to make a bullet-point post about a collection of remaining problems not only from the Trump administration, but also other past administrations (Obama, Bush, Clinton, etc.), and what's being done about them as far as I can scour on the web. If the 2020 elections made anything clear with record turnout, there are some deep fissures that we need to be conscious of, and do what we can collectively to at least mitigate if not resolve. Contact your representative in the US House and your Senators to voice your thoughts on these and other issues, and just do what you can.

- Pandemic economic stimulus: in progress, Biden signed orders laying the groundwork for further stimulus and allows for the increase of SNAP food benefits state-by-state -> https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-stimulus-check-executive-order-food-stamps-minimum-wage/

- This Twitter account is useful -> https://twitter.com/WaitingOnBiden so a handful of what follows could come from that 

- Tangential to economic stimulus is the cancelling of student debt. There were rumblings that this is under serious consideration as Bloomberg had a headline pop up on my phone. I'll leave the googling to y'all to confirm. The fact that Bloomberg (the news agency) is talking it up means a lot, at least to me.

- Family separations at the US-Mexico border, and the related detention/concentration camps (overview -> https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a27813648/concentration-camps-southern-border-migrant-detention-facilities-trump/): According to Mother Jones, it appears that Biden will be tackling that this upcoming week -> https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/01/trump-family-separation-biden-aclu/, Independent too -> https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/biden-immigration-mexico-amlo-call-b1791775.html

- Citizenship for undocumented immigrants: in progress per this, with congressional caveats as expected -> https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/1/20/sigh-of-relief-immigration-advocates-welcome-biden-proposal

- Healthcare -> A lot of opine pieces out there as of today... clearly the pandemic is overriding things at the moment

- Marijuana legalization: Good gesture towards that with the DNC leader pick -> https://www.marijuanamoment.net/biden-taps-marijuana-legalization-supporter-to-lead-democratic-national-committee/, and we have better than average odds in the legislature -> https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/health/a35279210/joe-biden-weed-legalization-cannabis-law-status/

- Climate, last, not at all least: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-climate/biden-administration-to-unveil-more-climate-policies-urges-china-to-toughen-emissions-target-idUSKBN29S0PA?il=0; https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/here-are-all-the-climate-actions-biden-took-on-day-one/

I've saved this list so I can add on, take out as needed. Heck, it may be useful to make a GitHub of it, and I did -> https://github.com/JoesephPaulSmith/BidenAdminMon . Anywho, again, we need to do what we can, and not lose sight of what's possible with the new arrangement in the national government. 

Good luck everyone, and have a good week
