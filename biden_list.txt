It's Easter 2021. Last week, when the bi-weekly Biden report was due, I was on a well needed vacation out to Hocking Hills, OH. I'll get select pics out from that in a couple weeks as to not curse myself. At any rate, Joe Biden is still POTUS, as he was lawfully elected as such. What's he been up to the past few weeks?

- Pandemic economic stimulus: signed, sealed, and *3rd* delivery in progress -> https://www.vox.com/2021/3/14/22330410/stimulus-checks-third-irs-when
-- lots of advice online regarding when you'll get yours, and how to spend it
-- a 4th stimulus is being floated out there, presumably as a trial balloon

- Tangential to economic stimulus is the cancelling of student debt: write your reps, senators on this one
-- "President Joe Biden has directed his education secretary to explore his authority to cancel student debt by executive order." -> https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/politics/2021/04/04/president-joe-biden-considering-student-loan-forgiveness/7006659002/

- Healthcare: nothing floating to the top this week from a quick scan

- Systemic racism:

- Gun reform:

I've saved this list so I can add on, take out as needed. Heck, it may be useful to make a GitHub of it, and I did -> https://github.com/JoesephPaulSmith/BidenAdminMon . Anywho, again, we need to do what we can, and not lose sight of what's possible with the new arrangement in the national government. 

Lastly, contact your representative in the US House and your Senators to voice your thoughts on these and other issues.

Good luck everyone, and have a good week
