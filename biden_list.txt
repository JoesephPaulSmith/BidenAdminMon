Every Sunday during the Biden Administration, I hope to make a bullet-point post about a collection of remaining problems not only from the Trump administration, but also other past administrations (Obama, Bush, Clinton, etc.), and what's being done about them as far as I can scour on the web. If the 2020 elections made anything clear with record turnout, there are some deep fissures that we need to be conscious of, and do what we can collectively to at least mitigate if not resolve. Contact your representative in the US House and your Senators to voice your thoughts on these and other issues, and just do what you can.

I've saved this list so I can add on, take out as needed. Heck, it may be useful to make a GitHub of it, and I did -> https://github.com/JoesephPaulSmith/BidenAdminMon . Anywho, again, we need to do what we can, and not lose sight of what's possible with the new arrangement in the national government. 

Good luck everyone, and have a good week
