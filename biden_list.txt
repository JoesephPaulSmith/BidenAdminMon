You know, what has Joe (Biden) been up to this week?
******Contact your representative in the US House and your Senators to voice your thoughts on these and other issues******

- Let's keep the pressure on Trump, ensuring he can never take office again. He's already got a speaking engagement at the CPAC conference next week. 

- Pandemic economic stimulus: to quote Ted Lieu (D-CA), "We will pass the American Rescue Plan legislation next week. It's a very good bill. And it's what the American people need during this challenging time" -> https://www.newsweek.com/1400-stimulus-checks-will-pass-house-next-week-says-democratic-lawmaker-ted-lieu-1570793 ("next week" should be in reference to this week, as that was said last week Friday, a couple days ago)
-- Details on Medicare and other healthcare related program changes here -> https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-biden-administration-s-potential-9860333/
-- It's the pace of 'any' stimulus being as slow as it is that really alarms me. We're a big country, and we've been starving ourselves of the things we desperately need for decades now (yes, even before the pandemic). People have literally and figuratively broken their backs to achieve any resemblence of a quality life, and that has had deep impacts across the board, not just in the overall economy, but also at a personal level: physical, biological, and consequentially mental deterioration. We need to stop this national self harm, and give ourselves some help and care.
--- Speaking of mental health: there's a really important discussion going on regarding the recent movie "Music" -> https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/9529005/kate-hudson-addresses-criticism-sia-music-movie (Google for more stories)

- This Twitter account is useful -> https://twitter.com/WaitingOnBiden so a handful of what follows could come from that 

- Tangential to economic stimulus is the cancelling of student debt: just chatter this week

- Family separations at the US-Mexico border, and the related detention/concentration camps (overview -> https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a27813648/concentration-camps-southern-border-migrant-detention-facilities-trump/):
-- Immigration reform proposal explained -> https://www.voanews.com/usa/us-politics/bidens-immigration-reform-proposal-explained
-- "Frank Sharry, the founder of the immigrant advocacy group America’s Voice, said Biden has “leaned in” on immigration, in contrast to the more cautious early days of Obama’s first term." -> https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/biden-administration-tries-to-transition-from-campaigning-on-immigration-to-managing-a-dysfunctional-immigration-system/2021/02/20/9c97efd4-6e51-11eb-9ed1-73d434b5147f_story.html (Other pullquotes: “I cannot overstate the fact that the prior administration completely dismantled the program and it takes time to rebuild it in a way that addresses the humanitarian needs of the individuals who seek to access it,” Mayorkas said. “And if people wait and they see how this works in an orderly, safe and efficient manner, that is the best ticket to greater success in the future.” ... “We can’t run away as Democrats from reality,” Gonzalez said. “We’re not going to separate families or cage kids, but we need to continue having smart, good policy on our border to deal with asylum claims.”)

- Healthcare: Vaccinations continue, check second article under stimulus for updates there.

- Systemic racism: lots of regional stories, nothing new otherwise

- Gun reform: nothing new... :/

- Climate, last, not at all least: Texas got hit hard by the greater variability in weather patterns brought on by climate change, with the deep diving polar vortex that impacted a large swath of the CONUS this week. Politics aside, my sincerest condolences to those who lost loved ones in the storm(s), and best wishes for a speedy recovery (or more likely, as speedy as possible).
-- The US has officially rejoined the Paris climate agreement -> https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/u-s-officially-rejoins-paris-climate-agreement/ (here we go!)

I've saved this list so I can add on, take out as needed. Heck, it may be useful to make a GitHub of it, and I did -> https://github.com/JoesephPaulSmith/BidenAdminMon . Anywho, again, we need to do what we can, and not lose sight of what's possible with the new arrangement in the national government. 

Good luck everyone, and have a good week
